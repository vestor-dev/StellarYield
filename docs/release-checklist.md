# Stellar Wave Release Readiness Checklist

Before submitting a PR for the Stellar Wave program, please ensure your contribution meets the following release readiness standards:

## 1. Issue Linking
- [ ] Your PR description includes `Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER` to automatically close the relevant issue.

## 2. Build & CI
- [ ] All GitHub Actions CI checks pass (linting, testing, format).
- [ ] The Vercel preview deployment builds successfully without errors.

## 3. Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Smoke Test:** You have manually verified the core happy path for your feature in the preview environment.
- [ ] **Smart Contracts:** Fuzzing and unit tests pass locally (`cargo test`).
- [ ] **Frontend:** Relevant `npm run test` checks pass.

## 4. Documentation & Visuals
- [ ] Any new or modified UI components include screenshots (Desktop & Mobile) in the PR description.
- [ ] If this is a new feature or smart contract, appropriate documentation and NatSpec comments have been added.
- [ ] (If applicable) The `README.md` or contributor guides have been updated to reflect new environment variables or architectural changes.

Keep your submission concise and ensure all checklist items are met prior to requesting a review.
## Deployment Checks

- Confirm the Vercel deployment for `main` finishes successfully.
- Confirm the Vercel project still points its **Root Directory** at `client`, with Install `npm ci --no-audit`, Build `npm run build`, and Output `dist`. See the "Vercel Deployment Settings" section in [`README.md`](../README.md) for the full table.
- Confirm any backend deployment job or hosting platform reports a healthy release.
- Confirm Soroban contract deployment steps, addresses, and network targets match the intended release.
- Record any updated contract addresses or environment values in the relevant docs or deployment notes.

## Post-deploy Smoke Checks

- Run `scripts/smoke-test.sh --json > smoke-results/latest.json` to capture machine-readable pass/fail output.
- Store JSON snapshots in `smoke-results/` (gitignored) or upload as CI artifacts for operator history.
- The transparency dashboard smoke panel can read a latest JSON payload from browser local storage under `stellar-yield.smoke-results`.

### Automated release smoke report (GitHub Actions)

After deploying frontend and backend, maintainers can run **Release smoke report** (`.github/workflows/release-smoke-report.yml`) via **Actions → Release smoke report → Run workflow**.

- **Inputs:** `frontend_url`, `backend_url` (required), optional `issue_or_pr_number` to post a Markdown table on that issue or PR (same repo only; token permissions may restrict forks).
- **Output:** Job summary + uploaded artifact `release-smoke-report-<run_id>` containing `smoke-report.md` with pass/fail per URL (backend health, yields, frontend root, static asset).
- **Rerun:** In GitHub Actions, use **Re-run failed jobs** or **Re-run all jobs** on the workflow run. Locally, use the rerun snippet printed at the bottom of `smoke-report.md`, or:

```bash
FRONTEND_URL="https://your-frontend.example" BACKEND_URL="https://your-backend.example" \
  node scripts/smoke-test.js --report --markdown-out=smoke-report.md
```

- **Portable report only (stdout):** `node scripts/smoke-test.js --report --markdown` (no file unless `--markdown-out=path` is set).

Default checks expect HTTP **200** on `BACKEND_HEALTH_PATH` (default `/api/health`), `BACKEND_YIELDS_PATH` (default `/api/yields`), frontend `/`, and `FRONTEND_ASSET_PATH` (default `/favicon.svg`). Override via workflow dispatch inputs or the same-named environment variables.

### Frontend

- Load the production site and verify the homepage renders without console-breaking errors.
- Confirm wallet connection UI still appears and basic navigation works.
- Verify at least one API-backed view loads expected data.

### Backend

- Check the deployed API health endpoint or primary route.
- Confirm logs do not show startup failures, missing environment variables, or connection errors.
- Validate at least one client-facing API request succeeds against the deployed environment.

## Rollback Notes

- If the frontend deployment is unhealthy, redeploy the last known good Vercel build via **Deployments → … → Promote to Production** in the Vercel dashboard.
- If the backend release is unhealthy, roll back to the previous stable deployment in the hosting platform.
- If a contract deployment is incorrect, stop frontend promotion of the new addresses and follow the contract-specific remediation plan before resuming traffic.

## Documentation

- Keep this checklist linked from `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Update the checklist when deployment tooling, approval policy, or smoke-test expectations change.
